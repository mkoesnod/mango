The heat of the Coachella Valley produces Keitt mangoes which are available for one month every year. Keitt mangoes are a bright green color and typically firmer than other types of mangoes. They are “green and soft when ripe”. <br><br>All imported mangoes are hot water treated to “kill” the natural bacteria found on the skin of mangoes. This involves dipping the mangoes into boiling water for a few minutes. Some believe the process “cooks" the inside of the mango resulting in less nutrients and weaker flavor of the fruit. Because California Keitt mangoes are grown in California, they are not subject to hot water treatment and considered a “raw” mango. The juicy and tangy flavor of the Keitt mango make it one of the best mangoes available, not to mention it lacks the typical stringy fibers that can sometimes make eating mangoes a messy affair. <br><br>When the Keitt’s are harvested in September and October, remember that they are ripe when their skin is bright green and have a slight give when squeezed. Buy a few harder mangoes and ripen them at home just like you would with an avocado. Placed on a window sill or in a brown paper bag somewhere warm will ripen the hardest mango in a few short days! </p><div id="mangoes"> <div class="leaf l1"></div><div class="x x1"></div><div class="leaf l2"></div><div class="x x2"></div><div class="leaf l3"></div><div class="x x3"></div><div class="leaf l4"></div><div class="x x4"></div><div class="leaf l5"></div><div class="x x5"></div></div></body></html>
